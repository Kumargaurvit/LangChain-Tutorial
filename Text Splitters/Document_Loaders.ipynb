The various components of your paper [title, text, heads, etc.] are already defined on \\nthe style sheet, as illustrated by the portions given in this document. The abstract should summarize the content of the pape r. Try to keep the \\nabstract below 150 words. Do not have references or disp layed equations in the abstract. It is imperative that the margins and style described \\nbe adhered to carefully. This will enable us to maintain uniformity in the final printed copies of the Journal. Papers not ma de according these \\nguidelines will not be published although its content has been accepted for publication.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in history, Messi has set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career, including eight Ballon d\\'Ors, six European Golden Shoes, and eight times being named the world\\'s best player by FIFA. In 2025, he was named the All Time Men\\'s World Best Player by the IFFHS. He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 46 team trophies. Messi\\'s records include most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals for a single club (672 for Barcelona), most goals in La Liga (474), most assists in international football (61), most goal contributions in the FIFA World Cup (21), and most goal contributions in the Copa América (32). A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 890 senior career goals and provided over 400 assists for club and country—the most of any player—resulting in over 1,300 goal contributions, the highest total in the sport\\'s history.\\nMessi made his competitive debut for Barcelona at age 17 in October 2004. He gradually established himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the first of four consecutive Ballon d\\'Ors, and by the 2011–12 season he set the European record for most goals in a season and established himself as Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer. During the 2014–15 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, he led Barcelona to a historic second treble, leading to a fifth Ballon d\\'Or in 2015. He assumed Barcelona\\'s captaincy in 2018 and won a record sixth Ballon d\\'Or in 2019. At Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, among others. Financial difficulties at Barcelona led to Messi signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he won the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. He joined MLS club Inter Miami in July 2023, leading the club to win their first MLS Cup in 2025, whilst also winning back-to-back league MVP awards in 2024 and 2025.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the national team\\'s all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. Several years after his senior debut in 2005, he won the gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Assuming captaincy in 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals in the 2014 World Cup, the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they lost. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 World Cup. Messi was central to ending Argentina\\'s 28-year trophy drought by winning the 2021 Copa América, which helped him secure his seventh Ballon d\\'Or that year. In the following year, he led Argentina to winning the 2022 World Cup, the country\\'s first in 36 years. This followed with a record-extending eighth Ballon d\\'Or in 2023. Messi was victorious at the 2024 Copa América, his third major international title.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world\\'s highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world\\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time\\'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023. In 2020 and 2023, he was named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, the first team-sport athlete to win it. In 2020, Messi was named to the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team and became the second footballer and second team-sport athlete to surpass $1 billion in career earnings. Following his arrival and impact on football in the US, Messi was named Time\\'s Athlete of the Year in 2023, and was bestowed with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by US president Joe Biden in 2025.', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi'}, page_content='Lionel Andrés \"Leo\" Messi (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team.

Since his debut in the friendly against Porto the previous November, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him. Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot.\\nMessi made his La Liga debut with Barcelona's senior team during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Montjuïc, coming on in the 82nd minute. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. As a substitute player, he played 244 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk. He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, in a 2–0 home win against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club. Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.\\n\\n\\n==== 2005–2006: Becoming a starting eleven player ====\\n\\nOn 24 June, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150 million. Two months later, on 24 August, he made his first start for the club against Fabio Capello's Juventus in the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages\")]"
